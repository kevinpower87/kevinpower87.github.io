<p>
When starting the code for this Interactive Programming project I decided to start off with my character because I need to fix a bit of my background. I decided to setup keyboard events for my character(Molly) to start off with. Before doing that I had to create a new flash file called ActionScript File and I named it “code.as”. In my character flash file, I went into the action panel which I had to type “include ”code.as”” which links the two files. After setting up that I converted my character into a symbol and give it a name and an instance name(mollyChar).

<p>
So now I can start working on my Keyboard Events, first task I did was working on my Left and Right Keyboard board events and which started off fine however I noticed my character’s frames weren’t moving so I checked my instances behaviour bar and noticed that it was on “Graphic” which I converted back to MovieClip. Even after that as well as changing the code to make it read better and made sure there was no errors my character will move left, right, up and down but it still won’t allow my frames to work while the character(object) is moving. I should also mention I put in Up and Down Keyboard Events as well as play and stop functions because I might get my character to walk up and down in my game.</p>    

<p>
 So the next time I tackle this I will have to fix my character’s movement to perfect it.
